		<h1>Bus Alert Mobile Appls</h1><br>
		<ul><ul>
			<li>Our project will focus on the creation of a bus tracker similar to the one on http://lextran.com/bustracker that will work on mobile platforms.</li>
			<li> At the moment we are planning on creating a native iOS app as well as a native Android app that would allow the user to see the interactive bus map on their phone. Lextrans webapp is formatted such that
			the map is difficult to use on a mobile device. Our app will fill a void that will help students and Lexingtonians to not miss the bus.</li>
			<li> We want to implement a feature that allows the user to subscribe to a specific stop, at a specific time of the day, for a specific bus, and get notifications that tell when the estimated arrival time of the bus is.
			<li>The success of our project will be judged on the functionality of viewing the real-time bus routes, the user friendliness of the app, and the functionality of the bus subscription feature.</li>
